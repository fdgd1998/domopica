This is my final project as a part of my studies (C.F.G.S. Administración de Sistemas Informáticos en Red).

This is a smarthome prototype using Windows 10 IoT Core, Raspberry Pi, Arduino and various electronic components.

The actual features of this project are:
- Home task automatization (lights, doors, curtains, alarm).
- Clean and customizable user interface.
- Alarm system using both PIN and RFID autentication.
- Use of I2C bus to build a communications between Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
- Automatic lights using a LDR sensor.
